# Plan 3 — Persistence + Auth + Per-Question Review

**Last updated:** 2026-06-06
**Repo:** `/Users/quzhenrong/rpas-lms` (remote: `github.com/ZhenrongQu/rpas-lms`, private)
**Branch:** `main` (committing locally; not yet pushed — `ahead of origin/main`)
**Plan:** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-06-persistence-auth-review.md` (9 tasks, TDD, subagent-driven) — committed `9d8da3c`
**Status:** 🚧 **In progress — 6 / 9 tasks done.** Persistence + auth + history complete. 60 tests passing; `pnpm typecheck` clean; `pnpm build` green. Only the review page (tasks 7–9) remains.

## Scope (confirmed with user)
Full scope: Prisma/**SQLite** persistence + **Auth.js v5 credentials** accounts + post-submission **per-question review** page. Engineering defaults (documented in the plan): questions stay in `content/question-bank.json` (only `User`/`ExamSession` persisted); answers stored as a JSON column; auth is **additive, never gating** (middleware stays pure next-intl); guest-history claiming deferred to Plan 4.

## Completed tasks (3 / 9)

| # | Task | Commit | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Prisma + SQLite scaffold | `e8a043c` | client singleton (`src/lib/db.ts`), Vitest test-DB wiring (globalSetup + `test.db`, `fileParallelism:false`), smoke test. **Prisma pinned to 5.22.0** (Node 20.14 < Prisma 7's required 20.19); plan was written for Prisma 5 so no impact. Added `.npmrc` + `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` for pnpm v10 build scripts. |
| 2 | PrismaSessionStore | `f8a6f31` | domain↔row mapping (JSON columns for questionIds/answers/result; DateTime↔epoch-ms); round-trip + cross-instance persistence tests. Added `userId?` to `ExamSession`. |
| 3 | Prisma store wired in + `userId` on `createMock` | `278ddd0` | `instance.ts` now uses `PrismaSessionStore` → sessions survive restart. `routes.test.ts` now runs against `prisma/test.db` and passes. 56 tests. |
| 4 | Auth.js v5 credentials + register endpoint | `8f4eab3` | `next-auth@5.0.0-beta.31` + `bcryptjs@3`; root `auth.ts` (Credentials, JWT, `session.user.id`); `/api/auth/[...nextauth]`; `POST /api/auth/register` (201/409/400). 59 tests. |
| 5 | Auth UI | `0022b3f` | sign-in + register pages, `SignOutButton`, header account state (session read in layout via `auth()`, passed to client header — no SessionProvider). Build green; `/signin` + `/register` routes. |
| 6 | Session→user linkage + Mission Log | `c500d49` | `POST /api/exam` stamps `userId` via context-tolerant dynamic `auth()` (guests/tests → null, `routes.test.ts` stays green); `listUserExamHistory()`; dashboard history panel (guest nudge when signed out). 60 tests. |

## Remaining (7–9) — the per-question review page
7. `buildReview` pure projection (TDD)
8. `getReview` service + `GET /api/exam/[id]/review` (TDD)
9. Review page UI + wire "Review Answers" button

## How to resume / verify (Plan 3)
```bash
cd /Users/quzhenrong/rpas-lms
pnpm install          # runs prisma generate via postinstall
pnpm exec prisma db push   # if prisma/dev.db missing
pnpm test             # 60 passing
pnpm typecheck        # clean
pnpm build            # green
```

# Plan 2 — Next.js App Shell + Drone HUD UI

**Last updated:** 2026-06-06
**Repo:** `/Users/quzhenrong/rpas-lms` (remote: `github.com/ZhenrongQu/rpas-lms`, private)
**Branch:** merged to `main` (feature branch `nextjs-app-shell` deleted)
**Plan:** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-05-nextjs-app-shell.md` (9 tasks, TDD, subagent-driven)
**Status:** ✅ **Plan 2 complete & MERGED.** PR #1 merged to `main` 2026-06-06 (merge commit `9ced925`). 49 tests passing (44 engine + 5 new); `pnpm typecheck` clean; `pnpm build` succeeds (10 routes). Next: Plan 3 (Prisma persistence + auth + per-question review).

## Completed tasks (9 / 9)

| # | Task | Commit(s) | Notes |
|---|------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | Next.js 15 + Tailwind 3 + next-intl scaffold | `2073a83` | Removed `type:module`; configs added; 44 tests still pass |
| 2 | i18n routing + EN/FR messages + root/locale layouts | `fda2b63`, `3e1d55d` | `/en` + `/fr` render; fixup dropped dead `moduleId` key, fixed FR `results.correct` |
| 3 | HUD design tokens CSS + visual structure | `fc9a52c`, `7b64795` | 640-line stylesheet; fixup removed cyclic font-vars, bounded `.results-view`, `bg-scene` pointer-events |
| 4 | Full HUD Header | `17b2d58`, `ca91833` | drone logo + radar + nav tabs + EN/FR switcher; fixup fixed switcher active-state on `/fr`. Also gitignores next-env/tsbuildinfo + commits Next auto-tsconfig |
| 5 | Dashboard page | `3d0c208`, `6730d9e` | sidebar + 8-card grid + ring + launcher; fixup numbers cards by grid index (MODULE_IDS order ≠ old hardcoded array) |
| 6 | ExamService additions + TDD | `c0c79bd`, `6ed4a29` | `getExpiresAt`/`getResult`, expiry enforce in `answer()` (`<=`), result storage + idempotent `submit()`, `GET /api/exam/[id]/result`; 49 tests |
| 7 | Exam launch page | `6fc6650`, `b9a4b14` | cert-level selector → POST /api/exam → redirect; fixup guards missing sessionId |
| 8 | Exam question interface | `7767659`, `f6ecb7a` | timer + Q-manifest + answer/submit; adds `getSessionMeta`. **Critical fixup:** `globalThis`-cached examService singleton so RSC + route handlers share the in-memory store (was 404ing the exam page); plus fetch error-handling (no infinite loading / stuck submit) |
| 9 | Results/debrief page | `136d284` | score ring + per-subject breakdown + weak-area highlight |
| — | Final-review i18n fix | `a4f5d1b` | translate MULTI "Select N" + results module names so FR pages don't leak English |

Each task passed spec-compliance + code-quality review; final whole-implementation review confirmed READY TO MERGE (build green, EN/FR catalogs identical 54 keys, security boundary intact — no `isCorrect` reaches the client).

## Key decisions / known gaps (carried to Plan 3)

- **In-memory store is process-local** behind `SessionStore`; shared across RSC + route handlers via the `globalThis` singleton in `instance.ts`. Sessions are lost on server restart — Prisma swap is Plan 3.
- **Module progress is all 0% / locked** on the dashboard — real progress tracking needs auth + persistence (Plan 3/4).
- **"Review Answers"** button links to the dashboard (no per-question review page yet — Plan 3).
- **Intentional hardcoded-English chrome** (not exam content): HUD "ADVANCED OPS" badge, dashboard launcher meta line, sidebar placeholder telemetry labels ("Mock exams taken"/"Best score", values "—"). Polish later.
- **Locale is session-locked:** question language is fixed at exam creation; switching UI locale mid-exam keeps question text in the original language (correct for an exam, but the `Lang:` label reflects URL locale).

## How to resume / verify (Plan 2)
```bash
cd /Users/quzhenrong/rpas-lms
pnpm install      # if node_modules missing
pnpm test         # 49 passing
pnpm build        # production build succeeds
pnpm dev          # http://localhost:3000 → /en ; full flow: dashboard → exam → submit → results
```

# Plan 1 — Exam Engine Core (complete)

**Last updated:** 2026-06-05
**Repo:** `/Users/quzhenrong/rpas-lms` (local only, **no remote** — never pushed)
**Branch:** `exam-engine-core` (base branch: `main`)
**Status:** ✅ **Plan 1 complete — all 12 tasks done.** 44 tests passing across 11 files; `pnpm typecheck` clean. Passed a final whole-implementation review (ready to merge).

## How to resume / verify
```bash
cd /Users/quzhenrong/rpas-lms
pnpm install      # if node_modules missing
pnpm test         # expect 44 passing, 11 files
pnpm typecheck    # clean
```
Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-05-exam-engine-core.md` (12 tasks, TDD, one commit per task).
Execution: Subagent-Driven Development — fresh implementer per task + two-stage review (spec compliance, then code quality), plus a final whole-implementation review.

## Completed tasks (12 / 12)

| # | Task | Commit | Files |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Toolchain scaffold (TS + Vitest + Zod) | `127400d` | package.json, tsconfig.json, vitest.config.ts, src/lib/sanity.test.ts |
| 2 | Domain types | `ff0b2d6` | src/lib/content/types.ts |
| 3 | Zod schema + invariants | `2007881` | src/lib/content/schema.ts(.test) |
| 4 | Validated bank loader (real bank passes schema) | `ba1f1e0` | src/lib/content/loadBank.ts(.test) |
| 5 | Exam specs + largest-remainder quota allocation | `5cbaa6b` | src/lib/exam/config.ts, quota.ts(.test) |
| 6 | Seedable RNG + weighted generation w/ backfill | `7e0ca03` | src/lib/exam/rng.ts, generate.ts(.test) |
| 7 | Server-side grading (SINGLE + MULTI) | `0dd89f3` | src/lib/exam/grade.ts(.test) |
| 8 | Scoring + per-subject breakdown | `6111add` | src/lib/exam/score.ts(.test) |
| 9 | Session store interface + in-memory impl | `fe61b08` | src/lib/exam/store.ts(.test) |
| 10 | Public question serialization (strips answers) | `c321fa6` | src/lib/exam/serialize.ts(.test) |
| 11 | ExamService orchestration | `732bbfc` | src/lib/exam/service.ts(.test) |
| 12 | API route handlers (create/questions/answer/submit) | `fe16027` | src/lib/exam/instance.ts, app/api/exam/** |

Each task passed both spec-compliance and code-quality review. A progress-log commit (`1bbf3b5`) sits between tasks 9 and 10.

## Definition of Done — met
- `pnpm test` green (44), `pnpm typecheck` clean.
- Create a weighted Basic 35-Q mock → fetch public questions with **no `isCorrect`** leaked → submit → scored result with per-subject breakdown. Each step proven by a test (unit + integration + HTTP-handler level).
- All grading is server-side; in-memory store swappable behind `SessionStore`.

## Key decisions / honest gaps (carried forward to Plans 2–4)
- **Scope is Plan 1 only:** pure engine + route-handler-shaped functions, runnable under Vitest with no running Next.js server. Next.js app shell, i18n UI, Prisma persistence, auth, LMS lesson rendering, dashboard = **Plans 2–4**.
- **Persistence is in-memory** behind `SessionStore`; Prisma drops in later behind the same interface.
- **Grading is server-only**; `isCorrect` never serialized to clients (enforced by `toPublicQuestion`; asserted at unit, service, and route layers).
- **Advanced mock returns 48, not 50:** the seed bank has only 48 eligible (Advanced + BOTH) questions. Generator never repeats/invents → returns `min(total, eligiblePool)`. To reach a true 50-question Advanced mock, author ≥2 more `ADVANCED`/`BOTH` questions in `content/question-bank.json`. Content task, not a code bug (asserted in Task 6 test).
- **Basic air-law is under-quota by 2 (silent distribution skew):** the weight table allocates 11 air-law questions for a Basic mock, but only **9** BASIC-eligible air-law questions exist. The generator draws those 9 and backfills the remaining 2 from other subjects, so every Basic exam silently has 9 (not 11) air-law questions and 2 extra elsewhere. The exam is still a valid 35 questions — this only affects per-subject *distribution*, not totals. Fix cleanly by adding ≥2 more `BASIC`/`BOTH` air-law questions to the bank. (Found in final review.)
- **Exam expiry is set but NOT enforced server-side in Plan 1:** `expiresAt` is stored on the session and returned to the client, but `answer`/`submit` do not reject late calls. Server-authoritative timer enforcement is a Plan 2 concern (the exam UI shows the countdown; Plan 2/3 should add an `expiresAt < now` check in `answer`/`submit`).

## Housekeeping notes
- Repo created fresh (home dir was not a git repo). Design artifacts (technical-design.md, question bank, plan) committed on `main`, then branched.
- Removed two stray throwaway files (`test-json*.ts`) a reviewer left at repo root during Task 9.

## Suggested next steps (post-Plan-1)
1. Author ≥2 more `ADVANCED`/`BOTH` and ≥2 more `BASIC`/`BOTH` air-law questions to close the Advanced-50 and Basic-air-law-distribution gaps.
2. Begin **Plan 2**: Next.js app shell + i18n routing, mount these handlers as real routes, build the exam UI (timer, question palette, per-subject results table) and a `GET /api/exam/[id]/review` endpoint (post-submission explanations).
